# Gaea
This is the first build of the personal project game. The code was edited on Visual Studios and run on the Renpy Launcher.

Scene:
  The only thing I have modified in the scene.rpy was adding a bar to the top of the screen using frame at around line 100.
  
Script:
  The script is so far only for scene 1 of the project, taking learners to the last holdouts of the Southern Song Dynasty
